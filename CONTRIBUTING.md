# Publishing a widget

1. Write it against the main repository's guide,
   [docs/writing-widgets.md](https://github.com/fdussert/fremkit/blob/main/docs/writing-widgets.md),
   and run it from a local `widgets/` folder until it behaves.
2. Give the manifest a `version` (semver) and an `sdk` (the bridge version it needs), and declare
   every channel, command and network host it uses — nothing else is granted.
3. Copy the folder to `widgets/<id>/` here, `<id>` being the manifest's `id`, and open a pull
   request. The CI validates the manifest, refuses private or local network hosts, checks the
   size, and builds the index on merge.
4. Keep the pull request to one widget, in English, with no personal data (hosts, tokens, names,
   screenshots of your own dashboard) — placeholders and the `192.0.2.x` documentation range only.

A new version is the same pull request with `version` bumped. A version that asks for a
permission the previous one did not is shown to every user as a new consent.

Reviews look at what the widget asks for and what it does with remote data (escape it with
`Fremkit.esc`), not at taste. Security concerns: see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Publishing a theme

A theme is colour tokens and nothing else: no code, no permissions, nothing for a user to
consent to. It is the easiest thing to publish here and the safest thing to install.

1. Copy `themes/fremkit/theme.json` from the [main
   repository](https://github.com/fdussert/fremkit) — it mirrors the dashboard's own
   `tokens.css`, so every token a theme can set is already in it.
2. Change `id`, `name`, `description` and the values. `id` is the folder name,
   `[a-z0-9_-]+`; `name` and `description` are `{ "fr": …, "en": … }` pairs; `version` is semver
   and only ever goes up. `author`, `license` and `homepage` are optional and shown on the card.
3. Drop it at `themes/<id>/theme.json` here — that folder and at most a `README.md`, nothing
   else — and run `pnpm validate`.

`fremkit` and `edge` ship with Fremkit so a fresh install has a choice with no network; those
two ids are refused here.

The four tokens `accent`, `bg`, `surface` and `text` are published in the index, which is what
the admin paints as a swatch strip — so a theme needs no preview image.

## Running the checks before you open it

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm validate
```

That is exactly what the pull request runs. The full list of what it refuses is in the
[README](README.md#what-gets-checked); the two easiest to trip over are that every text a user
sees must be a `{ "fr": …, "en": … }` pair, and that `version` must be greater than the one
already published.

To see your widget actually install, build and serve the index locally and point a development
Fremkit at it — [Testing the whole chain locally](README.md#testing-the-whole-chain-locally).
The packed bytes are reproducible, so the hash you get is the hash CI will get.

## About `tools/vendor/`

The manifest schema is Fremkit's, not this repository's: `tools/vendor/widgets/manifest.ts`,
`net/private.ts` and `backup/zip.ts` are byte-for-byte copies of the files of the same name in
[fdussert/fremkit](https://github.com/fdussert/fremkit). A copy rather than a submodule, so a
clone builds with nothing but `pnpm install` — and `pnpm check-vendor`, which both workflows run,
fetches the upstream files and fails the run on any difference. Never edit them here: change them
upstream, then copy them over in their own commit.
