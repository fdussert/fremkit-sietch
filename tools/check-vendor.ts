 * worst thing to leave unattended: a schema that lags behind publishes widgets the Fremkit
 * installer then refuses, and a schema that runs ahead promises authors a field no released
 * Fremkit reads. Either way the person who finds out is a user with a failed install.
 *
 * So both workflows run this. It fetches the upstream files and compares them; a difference
 * fails the run and names the file to copy over.
