/**
 * What a folder must be to get into the index.
 *
 * These rules exist twice on purpose: here, so an author learns at pull-request time, and in
 * Fremkit's installer, so a user is protected whatever a registry — this one, a fork, a
 * compromised Pages deployment — chose to publish. The installer is the one that matters; this
 * is the one that is kind. Neither is allowed to trust the other.
 *
 * Everything below is a property of the *package*, not of what it does: nothing here runs a
 * widget, and nothing here can tell whether the code inside does what it says. That is what the
 * human review in CONTRIBUTING is for.
 *
 * Two kinds live here. A **widget** is code, and carries the whole list. A **theme** is a JSON
 * file of colours: no code, no permissions, nothing to consent to — so its rules are about shape
 * and size, and they are short. The parts they share — walking a folder, the names an entry may
 * carry, the ceilings — are shared, and the parts they do not are not.
